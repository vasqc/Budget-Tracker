# Budget-Tracker

For this Challenge, starter code was given. The task, is to update the Budget Tracker app with current finances of incoming monies against expenditures. The app should not only have functionality online, but also for offline access. After the intial app is deployed, the user should be able to update deposits and keep track of their expenses of their budget with or without internet connection.  This functionality is made possible through the use of MongoDB and IndexedDB on the backend of the application.
