# Budget-Tracker

This week, I was given starter code and was tasked with updating the budget tracker application to allow for offline access and functionality. After the updates, the user should be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget regardless of if they have internet connection or not. The idea is, that when the user enters any transactions while offline, then these transactions should be registered and added to the total once the user has established a connection once again. This will be made possible through the use of MongoDB and IndexedDB on the backend of the application.
